This is a 2 page website for users to input and view blog posts.


## Help 
- Youtube: GreatStack 
This Youtuber helped me learn how to use CSS and JavaScript to create the light and dark mode on my blog.

## Usage 
For a user to create a new post, they need to fill out the form that lists multiple fields that list "Username", "Title", and "Content". Once the form is submitted, the user input will be redirected to the Blog.

Screenshot of the form:
