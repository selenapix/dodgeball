This is a 2 page website for users to input and view blog posts.


## Help 
- Youtube: GreatStack 
This Youtuber helped me learn how to use CSS and JavaScript to create the light and dark mode on my blog.

## Usage 
For a user to create a new post, they need to fill out the form that lists multiple fields that list "Username", "Title", and "Content". Once the form is submitted, the user input will be redirected to the Blog.

Screenshot of the form:

Once the user fills out all of the blank fields, they will be redirected to a new Blog page that will display the user posts. 
The user input is retreived from the saved data in local storage and then displayed as a post. 

If the user prefers dark mode, they can do so by selecting the moon icon in the right corner. It will transition into dark mode for the user, and switch to a sun icon. If the user wishes to transition back to light mode, they can do so by simply selecting the sun icon for a smooth transition back into light mode.
